This is an Android application for ShangHai University students.  
But for some reasons, I will not continue to work on this application:  
* This application used Bmob SDK but I don't think it is a good one and I will not to study or learn how to use it.  
* I have something else which attracks me a lot to do so I don't have much time to develop this application.  

Here are the progress of my work which may helps you to work with it better  
* I finished mostly ui program.  
* I finished mostly adapter program.  
* I finished database works.  
* I added a permission manager class and which will help you to handle permission problems.  
* I added some modles(Java Bean) but not enough.  

So what you need to do are:  
* Complete ui relatived works.  
* Complete settings page relatived works.  
* In NotifyActivity, you need to finish three fragments' adapter.  

If you are willing to use Bmob sdk, then you can see the documents in [Bmob](http://www.bmob.cn/)   
You may need to register an account and applay a API key.  
Anyway, thanks a lot to contribute on this application and GOOD LUCKS!
