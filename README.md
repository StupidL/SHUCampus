This is an Android application for ShangHai University students.  
~~But for some reasons, I will not continue to work on this application:~~
~~* This application used Bmob SDK but I don't think it is a good one and I will not to study or learn how to use it.~~~
~~* I have something else which attracts me a lot to do so I don't have much time to develop this application.~~

~~Here are the progress of my work which may helps you to work with it better~~
~~* I finished mostly ui program.~~
~~* I finished mostly adapter program.~~
~~* I finished database works.~~
~~* I added a permission manager class and which will help you to handle permission problems.~~
~~* I added some modles(Java Bean) but not enough.~~

~~So what you need to do are:~~
~~* Complete ui relatived works.~~
~~* Complete settings page relatived works.~~
~~* In NotifyActivity, you need to finish three fragments' adapter.~~

~~If you are willing to use Bmob sdk, then you can see the documents in [Bmob](http://www.bmob.cn/)~~
~~You may need to register an account and applay a API key.~~
~~Anyway, thanks a lot to contribute on this application and GOOD LUCKS!~~

## I am working on it again!
